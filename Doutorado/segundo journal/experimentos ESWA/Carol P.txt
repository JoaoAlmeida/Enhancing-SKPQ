Lobby was warm and friendly, staff was knowledgeable. The room was clean, comfortable and quiet. My one night stay was outstanding. The location of this best western was right off the interstate highway with plenty of restaurants to choose from. It also had it's own restaurant.	Region President	Rochester	Carol P	New York
