5,'Wonderful stay at DAR AL MASYAF !	My 12 nights stay at Dar Al Masyaf in DUBAI last August was wonderful ! After 33 years travelling around the world, I can assure that this hotel offers an extremely high standard of services, one of the best I ever experienced. All staff is at all times so courteous, helpful, patient, smiling that you feel very spoiled to be there and treated like that. I congratulate again all of them who looked afer me in August with a special thanks to my butlers : Ning, May, Laarni, Alwyn and Ditto. I appreciated a lot the villa in which I had my room. Nowhere I had seen such a concept : private villas for a few rooms with their own butlers. My room (1st floor of villa 17) was absolutely quiet : not a single noise day and night. It was a very luxury one and included a super bathroom. Of course, it was absolutely clean and I slept in the best sheet I never had ! I got everyday free newspaper and a basket of fruit.There is one swimming-pool for a small group of villas if you want to stay close to your villa or do not want to use the hughe one by the sea. The swimming-pools are refreshed (about 27° Celsius) so they seemed to cold for me... I swam daily in the sea. Of course, the beach is as clean as all this complex of 3 hotels in which you have Dar Al Masyaf. Comfortable chairs, some elegant tents where you can close the curtains, swimming-guards all along the beach. You are provided with some fruit and oshibori during the day. At this time of the year, the beach was almost empty... The choice of restaurants which you have in the whole complex is incredible. But most often I used the main one at Al QASR (Arboretum) as well as the excellent Al Fayrooz Lounge.I used the Spa once. Very nice but the rates were too high for me (specially compare to India where I was last May) and did not allow me to use it more.To go from one place to the other one inside the complex, you can use either a buggy or the boat on the romantic artificial river if you do not want to walk. I felt very secure everywhere day and night.I used the conference center for Internet. They offer a great service as well and somebody came on purpose to help me to record CDs. I spent a full day at Wild Wadi inside the complex of the 3 hotels and had much fun. As resident of Dar Al Masyaf, the entrance of this park was free every day.To go out, you have either taxis or free shuttle to Dubai Mall or Mall of Emirates. Everything is very easy and a very competent staff is looking after you outside the entrance of Al Qasr which is also used as the entrance of Dar Al Masyaf. You can go and have a buffet with a nice show under the stars outside Dubai at Babs Al Sham by using the free shuttle from the hotel as this place belongs to the group.From Dar Al Masyaf, I went with a taxi on a day tour to Abu Dhabi. And with a travel agency (Khasab Travels and Tours which I can recommend), I spent 2 days in Musandam (Oman) where I had a wonderful 4 hours trip in the mountains and a wonderful full day cruise in the fjords. In the meantime, I kept my room at Dar Al Masyaf.If there is one thing I can regret is that too many tourists are not clothed inside Al Qasr as they should (according to my point of view of course...) and even inside the malls in Dubai. I mean that there is a great difference between the luxury of lobbys, lounges, halls, and the unelegance of some tourists with shorts and tongs. But what can the hotel do for that ? I hope that this review will convince you to stay at Dar Al Masyaf and that you will have the same wonderful experience as I had ! P.S. I wrote this review in english instead of french so that more people could read it. Apparently my 10 pictures could not be sent so I mail again my message but without them. Anyway there are already on the website a lot of pictures taken by other tourists who visited this wonderful hotel.'
5,'Fantastic Resort (Except for Cots)	We stayed at Dar Al Masyaf for the second leg of our stay in Dubai, having spent the first part at The Atlantis. We enjoyed our stays at both locations greatly, and the two hotels were very different so it almost felt like two holidays in one.On arrival at Al Qasr we were fortunate enough to be upgraded to Dar Al Masyaf; the Arabian Villa we were given was enormous with a large living room, three balconies, a beautiful bathroom, a huge stand alone bath and shower area, and twin sinks.The style is very much that of traditional Arabic, with lots of dark wood and ornaments around the rooms, as well as a huge bed. We have a kingsize bed at home but the beds in Dubai hotels seem to be twice as big, and this one was no different!As the only bad point of our stay was right at the start, I ll cover it now and it is really only relevant to those travelling with infants. We emailed the hotel ahead to ask for a baby cot and steriliser for our room as we were travelling with our 12 month old daughter.The cot in our room when we arrived was a very small, dirty travel cot. After having stayed at Le Royal Meridien and Atlantis with the baby previously in Dubai, both of which provided a very large, modern wooden cot this was a bit of a shock.There was no way we were having our baby sleep in tha cot, so we asked for it to be replaced by a wooden one. The wooden one they brought was also very dirty and rickety to the point of being dangerous - it was actually stuck together with sticky tape!We complained about this one and they brought another one in a slightly better state of repair but not much, and again it didn t look very clean, so we gave up at that point and the baby slept in our bed in between us. Fortunately the bed was of an ample size for us to do this and all have our own space, but it was difficult when we got home; she had become used to being in with us and wouldn t go back to sleeping in her own cot without a fight!We found it a bit strange that such an astonishing, lavish hotel provided such poor baby cots; for anyone travelling with an infant the most important thing above everything else is their baby s safety and comfort, so this should be a priority.Apparently the hotel has a large consignment of new baby cots on order so hopefully this won t be a problem in the future, but for those travelling with a small baby it may be worth sending an email to check on this before you travel.So that was a bad start for us, however from there on in it was fantastic all the way. For people looking for a beach holiday, the setup there really is perfect. The beautiful white beach looks out onto the Arabian Gulf and the Burj Al Arab towers above.They have fantastic wooden day beds, very comfortable with enough space for two, or in our case for one little one! The guys on the beach set us up perfectly so that we had two loungers next to a day bed, so when baby got tired she was able to have her nap in safety and shade on the day bed, whilst we caught some sun on our loungers.The service was excellent if you wanted a snack, and the guys came round with cooling lemon or pineapple lolly ices which the baby loved. The pool area is also very nice, very large and right next to the beach so you can take a dip easily.For all these reasons the daytime setup is perfect, whether you prefer to relax by the pool, on the beach, or have the best of both worlds. We have stayed at numerous five star hotels in Dubai all of which were fantastic in their own way, but Al Qasr / Dar Al Masyaf has the best daytime setup of any of them and this was our favourite feature.The complex is absolutely enormous and very spread out, so if you have to travel anwhere you are usually going by buggy (eight seater golf buggies) or Abras (Venice type gondoliers). We had breakfast in the main buffet restaurant in Al Qasr near the lobby every day and there is an excellent selection on offer.We had dinner in several restaurants, all of which were very nice but quite expensive (although not overly so for Dubai). We ate in the Thai and Italian restaurants a la carte, as well as going to The Jumeirah Beach Hotel for the buffet which we were entitled to eat in as part of the deal, as we were staying half board.They have happy hour in the hotel every evening which is a great idea and a good benefit. Between 7pm and 9pm (7:30pm when we were there due to Ramadan) they open up the bar in the courtyard of your villa complex and the drinks are free. This is particularly good as alcohol in Dubai is so expensive, plus it encourages the guests to mingle and have a drink together.Travelling around the complex on the Abras really gives you a feel for the resort and helps you appreciate the breathtaking size and expense of the complex. It is like a small city in itself, and unlike any hotel we had ever stayed in before. Waiting for a buggy can be a bit of a pain at rush hour (when everyone is going out to dinner) but the rest of the time you just get used to being whisked from place to place.The staff are wonderful, and the service was extremely good. In Dar Al Masyaf you have your own butler 24 hours a day, and our butler for the majority of our stay was a guy called Abyot. Abyot was absolutely fantastic; always smiling and laughing, couldn t do enough for you and with a great knowledge of the resort.Our other butler later in the day Mahesh was excellent as well, as was our cleaner Indu who was brilliant with the baby and brought her little rubber ducks and teddies. From our arrival the manager Sophie was fantastic as well; she was extremely professional in all the assistance she gave us throughout our stay.Overall we would have absolutely no hesitation in recommending Dar Al Masyaf, and hope to return again with family at some point in the near future. It is a truly spectacular resort, and the perfect location for people wanting to have a relaxing beach / pool holiday with plenty of eating options and no real need to leave the complex as everything you need is of an extremely high standard and just a short ride away.'
5,'Amazing......	Well, what can I say, this is my second visit to this hotel in the last 2 months and it amazing !The villas are spread throughout the Mudinat resort and you can choose between an Arabian Summerhouse or a Gulf Summerhouse. Villas 1 - 8 are Gulf Summerhouses and are located directly on the beach (some rooms have direct access) and the Arabian villas (Villas 9 - 29 I think) are quieter and doted around the vast resort. You can travel around the Mudinat complex by golf buggy or Abra and makes everything accessable. Each Villa has its own butler who can help with restaurant reservations or just general information. Every evening there is Sundowner where you can get complimentary drinks between 6.30 - 8.30 (although during Ramadam this is only for one hour from 7.30) Rooms are spacious, massive bathrooms and very well furnished. The beach is fantastic, clean, great sunbeds and serviced by many helpful people who will help with towels as well as food and drink. Both Mina and Al Qasr have pools which can be used, Al Qasr is much larger and we never struggled to get a nice bed. Amazing choice of restaurants - you can use all of the restaurants in the Souk, Mudinat, Jumeirah Beach hotel and the Burj...... This time we stayed for 6 nights and ate at Noodle House, Carnavelle, MJs and Arboretum. We recieved a 30% discount each night because we paid on our Visa card and were a Sirius member. Great deal, look out for them, they make eating on resort very affordable. Meals, restaurant and staff all great !Lastly, if travelling with Children the added advantage of free access to Wild Wadi is brilliant, you can go in and out as many times as you want during your stay. Amazing waterpark that is great for all the family. Would definately go back and am already planning my next visit.'
5,'Perfect	This place is complete paradise. You have everything right at your fingertips (Butler service makes sure of it!) and at the same time you still have a great deal of privacy. A ton of amazing restaurants to choose from along with nice and trendy lounges. Super clean pools and beach. Very beautiful and very calm. Huge property... be prepared to walk, take a buggy or boat. Close to great shopping and even more great restaurants!'
5,'We Love this Hotel	The room, the grounds, the restaurants and the views are all amazing, this is my second trip to the Madinat and we love it. The room is spacious, clean and well equipt, you are also so well looked after by the staff. The Dar Al Masyaf summerhouses have there own staff with lobby area, between 6 - 8 in the evening they hold a complimentry drinks service, you can anything you like from the branded drinks they also have on offer champagne. Our daughter was so well treated as well, on arrival she received a teddy bear and complimentry tolietry set, and every night on her pillow she received other little things like rubber ducks, lip balm, games and sweets. The villas also share private pools which are always so peaceful if you like to get away from the bussle of the large al qsar pool. The food was wonderful, we particularly liked the mina a salam buffet restaurant with its outdoor eating area with the view of the Burj al arab. We didnt find the drinks or food overly priced which we did expect as it is Dubai. Transport around the large hotel complex is either by golf buggy or by the little boats around the waterways, the water taxis are a lovely novelty. On the Madinat complex, it has its own souk with restaurants and shops, this gives you a different aspect as it does actually feel as though you are venturing out away from the hotel for a meal or drink. The hotel also has a very professional spa, the massage is a real treat. Although we will be trying another hotel next year, we will be back.'
5,'Utopia!	There are insufficient superlatives to describe Dar Al Masyaf. I have been fortunate to have travelled extensively over the last 30 decades and this resort is without doubt the best I have ever stayed in. Its flawless, exciting, relaxing, opulent, luxurious, remarkable and it will stimulate all your senses from sight through to taste! Everything about it really is superb. Service at all levels is simply exemplary, the staff are surely some of the best trained in the world. From the moment we were met at the airport by their staff right through until the time we departed, our holiday really was perfect. Romantic heaven!We had a suite in one of the summer villas. It was enormous, having 3 balconies to choose from! The suite was luxury personified. I have never stayed anywhere that was kept so scrupulously clean during an entire stay and that extends across the whole resort too. A huge basket of fresh fruit was replaced each day and the in-room amenities were just right-the Bose sound system and two HD TVs were impressive. The huge and very comfortable bed was complimented by a pillow menu (the lavender filled- one is wonderful) With some 130 square metres of opulence to enjoy, who would not be ecstatic in one of these suites!Staying in a villa you have the best of all worlds that this resort has to offer; the tranquillity and charm of an Arabic summer villa overlooking a calm waterway, a pristine beach just a short buggy ride away, shared pools, numerous restaurants and relaxing bars. A whole host of shops and other facilities cater to your every whim too. Fixtures and fitting in the entire resort have been well thought out with impeccable taste. The butlers in our villa, Jobe and George to name just two, were so amazingly attentive and helpful. At times it was so quiet here we could not believe we were in a large resort in the middle of the developing metropolis of Dubai. The buffet breakfast taken in Al Qasr’s Arboretum was amazing. Virtually every variety of breakfast items from around the globe is available and the quality is excellent. I would also recommend that you do utilise the facilities in the adjacent Burj; simply incredible. This Dubai icon justifiably deserves its unique 7 star status. Again I was so utterly impressed by the staff who work here.We left the resort baffled how such luxury, service and facilities are provided for what does amount to comparatively inexpensive prices. My message to all luxury hotels everywhere; take a good hard look at what the Jumeirah group is providing, it’s setting the standard that all other hotels should aspire to. This is how good service should be done.'
5,'Prepare to be spoilt!	This was our 4th stay in Dubai, each time having stayed within the Jumeriah/Madinet complex. 2 years ago we stayed within the hotel - Al Qasr, and so this time wanted to try the villas - we were not disappointed. We were initially put in villa 24 - which we found was quite a distance from the main pool area, so we asked to be moved, which we were to villa 16. This was much better and we soon found a short cut to the main hotel. The villa was outstanding, always exceptionally clean, butler service was nice and also the 2 hour happy hour from 6-8pm. The butler will call a buggy or Abra for you to go anywhere in the complex. I would recommend The Meat Co. restaurant and Beachcombers at Jumeriah Beach Hotel. Also check out the new Dubai Mall and its great aquarium and aquarium zoo.This visit we also did a desert safari through Arabian Adventures. It was excellent, very good value for money and great for everyone (dune buggying, bbq, camel rides, henna painting, belly dancer etc).We have stayed at 4 other hotels in Dubai (including the Burj) and the Dar al Maysaf is by far our favourite. We spent the last 2 nights of our holiday at the Atlantis - what a mistake, wish we had spent these last 2 days back at the villas!'
5,'Most amazing hotel - so sad to leave!!	My teenage daughter and I were booked into the Dar al Masyaf at the Madinat Jumeirah hotel for 11 nights.As we pulled up outside the Al Qasr lobby upon arrival, our first thoughts were &quot;WOW!&quot; There were gold horse statues, and a wonderful water fountain. The chaps at the entrance were all fantastic! They took our cases for us and lead us in to the lobby, which was spectacular, beautiful.We sat in the lobby where we were given cold towels and offered drinks by a member of staff called Shine, who was very helpful. They told us our room would be ready in about 1 hour, but they were early, and we got in our room after just 30 minutes! We got a buggy from the lobby which took us to our Dar Al Masyaf villa, which was very quick. The butlers in the villa are excellent, a very helpful one was Tiger. Your butler is on call 24hours, and they can bring you ice, book you buggies, abras and make your dinner reservations. Rooms are fantastic, very spacious, we had an Arabian summerhouse. The rooms are lovely and cool, with an air conditioning and fan switch, so you can choose your rooms temperature. There is also a coffee making facilitie, free internet access, a telephone, ice buckets, complimentary fruit bowl, and ice pot. Also, there is a mini bar and mini fridge. Upon arrival, the butler came to our room and guided us around the room and showed us everything about the room and the hotel resort. The bathrooms are AMAZING..with a gorgeous huge shower, bath, toilet and two sinks. Everything was clean and in great working order.Rooms are very clean, and get cleaned twice a day, once in the morning, and once in the evening where they draw your curtains, put ice in your ice pot, and leave little gifts on your beds. Once it was chocolates, once it was massage oil, once it was lip balm and hand cream and body scrubs which I thought was a nice touch! By the door, is a switch to say whether you want room cleaning. It says (Do not disturb..or..Service my room) and when you select one of them, it will go red or green, and the cleaner can see this light from the outside.We had a waterway view room which was lovely and the balconies are MASSIVE!!The villa private pools are great, often busy during the day, but after 6pm, they are mainly empty. A lifeguard is there till 10pm, so theyre very safe, but they do stare as you swim which can be a bit uncomfortable, but nevertheless, not a big deal.The gardens and grounds surrounding the Dar al Masyaf Arabian summerhouses are stunning, and kept very well, beautiful plants and lawn is mowed etc.The weather in July-August is scorching. Very humid and hot. After 5pm was our favourite time to go outside, otherwise it is just too hot (for us, anyway) Only complaint about being in a Dar Al Masyaf room was getting buggies for dinner. Sometimes they took up to 20 minutes to arrive and our butler had to call 3 times at once for the buggy to arrive. This did happen quite frequently aswell. For one instance, we had a dinner reservation and our butler ordered us a buggy, and they said we would have to wait for 15mins so we had to walk up to the al qasr lobby (not a too long walk, but still we shouldnt have to walk) and there were about 5 buggys empty and their drivers were just chatting and laughing, which was bad as they had only told us to wait as they couldnt be bothered to pick us up!Anyway, food at the Madinat is outstanding in my opinion!Breakfast - breakfast has a huge variety such asfruits - pineapple, mixed fruit salad, apple, grapes, melon, grapefruit, the list goes on...cooked breakfasts - baked beans, pork sausages, veal sausages, waffles, mushrooms, chicken noodlessavoury foods - chicken, turkey slices, smoked salmon, salads, lettuce, tomatoespancakes etc - crepes, french toast, waffles, sometimes there were egg omlettes, chocolate sauce, maple syrup, strawberry saucebreads - a large variety of breads and cheese and buttersyogghurts - a great selection of yoghurts, strawberry, blueberry, blackberry etc, very nice!suchi - yes, there was suchi at breakfast!juices - lemon&amp;mint, orange, grapefruit, watermelon juiceand also for drinks you can order water and coffee, hot chocolate and cappachinos and milk.lunch/brunch - we never had a proper lunch of brunch at the madinat, as we were half board but one time we did have a late lunch at the al qasr poolside restaurant. Portions were huge but very yummy. We had nachos, delicious, and the club sandwich with chips which was so delicious! Highly reccomended.dinner - we mainly had dinner at the Al Qasr main lobby restaurant (a buffet) called the Arboretum, and it was AMAZING! There was practically everything you could imagine!From breads, currys, butter chicken, salmon, salads, roast meats, potatoes, anything really.Some nights there was pasta with a great selection of pastas and sauces.Service at this restaurant was GREAT!All the staff here were perfect, they remembered our names, and always had a smile on their face, they remembered the drinks we always ordered and drinks always arrived quickly, and whenever you finished with one plate, it was cleaned away immediately.Lone Lone was a great waitress there, infact all of them were.They were all very sweet, for example, my daughter was getting some tomatoes onto her plate and they were hard to pick up on the small spoon, so a waiter did it for her.Deserts were good too, cheesecakes, pavlovas, fruit salads, ice creams, chocolate fountains and things to dip in, creme brulees, chocolate mousses, fruit mousses etc, etc.As half board, we got to eat for free in 3 restaurants.These were:Arboretum at Madinat JumeirahA restaurant in Mina a SalamA restaurant in Jumeirah BeachWe went to the Jumeirah Beach Buffet restaurant one night, and their selection of foods were wonderful, but service was quite useless. It was nothing compared to the Madinat Jumeirah.Took them 20 minutes to bring water and orange juice, and they never cleared our plates, so eventually we had to pile our plates up to make room!Another night we went to MJs steak house at the Madinat Jumeirah, which is next door to the Arboretum buffet restaurant at the Al Qasr, and it was AMAZING too! Steak was perfectly cooked, chips great, menu selection excellent. Kids menu was great too. Food didnt take too long to arrive, service brilliant. There was a slight confusion with our order but they fixed it immediately.Deserts delicious there too.The Souk at Madinat Jumeirah is quite good. It has a good pharmacy but it seems to only sell expensive top brands. There was also a small stall with great natural beauty products such as moisturising soaps, preventations for hair loss, freckle solutuions, cures for bags under the eyes, and natural exfoliants..some lovely things.Also, there were some lovely clothes shops with fantastic sales on them!My daughter got Animal boardshorts for £8 which are £20 in the UK!A great place to get some good deals.Complimentary busses run from the Al Qasr lobby every 0 clock and half past, (every 30 mins) to the emirates mall and it takes 15 minutes to get there. Our butler printed out a leaflet of the bus times for the emirates mall.Emirates mall is brilliant, we went there countless times!Has everything there, amazing shops and some really good sales on designer brands like GUESS, Tommy Hilfiger etc.We went to the Mall of Dubai once too (biggest mall in the world!!) and it was MASSIVE! We barely got to see much of it, and time flies when youre shopping in the malls, before you know it, its 5 hours later!We personally prefered the Emirates Mall as it is closer to the hotel, mall of dubai takes 45 minutes to get to via complimentary bus!I think that is all I need to say really, I think Ive covered most things!Overall it was the BEST hotel I have ever stayed in, a real touch of luxury, and a huge thankyou to te Madinat Jumeirah for such a perfect locaction and vacation.We will deifinitely return soon!'
5,'Loved the hotel but ....	I loved the hotel liked everything .. having a butler who is there 24/7 for you was a unique service everything i asked for came quick and fast to my room.the room was clean the bathroom was 100% clean and shiny. plus i liked the body products they had in the bathrooms PERFECT.but the breakfast wasnt that good i ordered english breakfast. was a bit disappointed.'
5,'Near perfect	We have just returned from nearly 2 weeks in the gorgeous resort of Jumeirah Dubai.We went to Dubai with an open mind really expecting building work all around us and service not actually up to the hype.We were truly very pleasantly surprised.The summerhouses we stayed in are part of the Jumeirah resort and possibly one of the nicest parts.Our summerhouse was private and secluded and they all have a little private courtyard in the middle of 9 rooms. All the rooms are serviced by a butler who is in the little reception area 24 hours a day and who will sort anything out for you. They were always incredibly courteous and helpful.At 6pm we would sit outside in the courtyard for our &quot;happy hour&quot; where drinks were served for 2 hours, complimentary.The whole resort is serviced by buggies and abrhas(little boats) and makes getting around easy and enjoyable.Our room was spacious enough for 2 adults and 2, 11 year olds but I think the sofa bed is not ideal for anyone older and Im not surprised children older than 12 have to be accommodated in another room.The huge bathroom though meant that the room actually felt more spacious than it probably was.It was lovely.I loved the beach area and there was always plenty of staff to help you settle comfortably on the beach wherever you wanted to be. The advantage of the arabian summerhouses was that after a day on the beach , or wild wadi ( complimentary to all guests at Jumeirah) we could chill out in the private pool area next to our summerhouse. ( shared with 2 others). This is particularly good for families with young children. There are lifeguards everywhere including at the private villa pools.I was impressed with the excellent way ALL the staff had been trained to be of an exceptional standard of efficiency and politeness. Nothing was ever too much trouble and we were always greeted with courteousness and a smile.I loved the harmonious mix of races both staff and guests.Wild wadi water park is great for the kids and because it is included in your stay you can go as many times as you want. We went many times, just for a couple of hours.I was truly impressed how immaculate and clean it was. Again the staff were fantastic and lifeguards were everywhere, always with a smile .Everyone we met (staff) asked us always, how are you?The restaurants at Jumeirah are all very good and not as expensive as we had been led to believe. The worst experience was at the Burj al Arab where we were made to feel very unwelcome. My 11 year old son, as smart as he was, was almost not let in to the restaurant because he didnt have closed shoes. While I agree with a sensible dress code, I was disgusted at the way we were made to feel inadequate. When we pointed out he was 11 they said OK. Our bill was £600 so we were not exactly ruffians coming off the beach!The restaurant staff were very rude.All the other restaurants were great with the children.I wouldnt recommend the restaurants in the souk madinat. These are not run by Jumeirah and you can tell. They are not good and the staff are totally different.As for the building work, we had none near us unless you count &quot;the Palm&quot; in the distance.Dubai is not a beautiful place, its like canary wharf , but the beach resorts are excellent.We all had a fantastic holiday and I would say it caters for all ages and all expectations.We will be back.'
1,'Worst hotel ever!!!	This is a hotel to avoid if you are visiting Dubai. Rooms are in urgent need of updating. The linen are dirty. Even though when they are changed.... still contains other peoples hair. I stayed there for two weeks and the linen was only changed once. The toilets were never cleaned. The room was never hoovered once. Even putting the sign outside my room to clean the room was ignored for two weeks. I got food poisoned after having the buffet food at the restaurant. Whatever you do... avoid the food at the hotel restaurant. Getting them to call for a taxi is a nightmare. They fob you off and eventually when they do call for one it will be like 2hrs later. One night they kept me waiting for an hour and did not have the decency to tell me if they had called for a taxi or not. I got into an arguement over this and the duty manager stepped in. He himself is a rude and arrogant person. He ordered his bell boys not to open the doors for me everytime i came in and out of the hotel. Ever since that arguement, they never called me a taxi if i ever needed one. Luckily, I made a friend locally and he had a car. This meant I never needed their service for anything. I used the hotel only for somewhere to sleep at night. If I hadnt of paid in full, then I would have definately moved to another hotel. A refund was not possible either. The lifts also smelt very foul. At night it was very noisy and was blasting out music till 4am in the morning. The windows were broken which meant the room was boiling hot and you could not sleep much at night because of the road and construction noises. The air con did not work and after complaining many times I just gave up because they were not interested in listening. Its centrally operated air con system which meant they have control over it. The overnight stayers from the club caused so much disturbance. They would constantly scream, shout and slam the doors. I think you get the image of this hotel now and I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. Even if you were a single male. Please avoid this at all costs!!'
1,'I will never stay again	I was in the hotel for 4 days with my friends. The lady on front desk is not really help full.Rooms are very small according to money. Breakfast was the worst they mix tang in the water and give you as fresh juice. Only one lady and a guy are working in the resturent. The give you south Indian food for break fast. Every morning we have to go and tell the lady that dishes need to be fill in. In the night time is to noise. Cleaning guys had a smiling face but never did there work.'
1,'Dont go here	This hotel was very disappointing. Despite advertising airport pick-up our request was totally ignored. We found it impossible to stay in the first room we were allocated. It was very stuffy and the air conditioning which was nearly non-existent did not do anything to help. The window had been screwed down and was impossible to open. We asked to change rooms and the second room was inhabitable despite the cracked sink and leaking bath!. A fellow guest with the same problem decided not to stay at all and checked out immediately to go and find another hotel. The working staff were anxious to help us, especially in the restaurant where the food was good value for money, but the management was very poor. This was an experience we would not wish to repeat.'
1,'Avoid it if you can	This is a very disappointing hotel and represents poor value for money. Okay, it might be less expensive by normal Dubai standards but you cant help getting that ripped off feeling. I have read other reviews that said the rooms are small. That is an understatement. It appears clean but is badly in need of basic maintenance and decoration. The basin in our bathroom was blocked and we had to share with a cockroach but the hot water was plentiful. Most staff were friendly and helpful but one was quite the opposite. Our advice would be pay a little extra and avoid this one. It has the potential to take the shine off your holiday.'
1,'worlds worst pick-up joint.	This is the worst place ever. It is a dirty disgusting pick-up joint!As soon as you walk into the bar after about 6pm, you will be visited by numerous amounts of woman, asking you if you have any requests!!!!!! If you know what i mean.The rooms were disgusting, the music from the club below bellowed until the early hours, filling the whole hotel with unbearable noise. If you are single, have little or no money, and dont mind sleeping it (totally) rough in Dubai, then this is the place for you!'
1,'Caution Advised	This is a very basic budget hotel, If you want a quiet night I recommend getting a room on the 4th floor because there is club blasting music out until 3-4am usually populated with asians. The rooms are not the best with mould round the bathroom, however the bed was clean. It came to my attention that this hotel catered mainly for men. Which did not make it feel safe for me and my wife. The staff were friendly even when they had initially messed up the booking by giving us a room on the 2nd floor when we arrived, not the 4th as I requested. I do not recommend the food, it did not look appealing. This hotel you get what you pay for.'
1,'Bedbugs!	The front desk people were nice and efficient, the other staff very friendly, the room and bathroom appeared clean and tidy. It was only when we decided to hit the sack that we discovered that the bed was literally crawling with bedbugs. I dashed downstairs to the reception to report the problem and we were moved with no fuss into a triple further down the corridor. The beds there were bug free and we had a decent sleep. The breakfast next morning was OK too. So weve mixed feeling about this hotel - the price and location are hard to beat, but the bed bugs are nasty creatures.'
1,'To be avoided at all costs	We stayed here last week, last stop after Australia. It was overall a very negative experience, our lst room was surrounded by building sites, noise overwhelming so we asked to be changed. Our next room was next to the mosque so we were awoken at an unearthly hour! The rooms were spacious but not clean, the hood of the cooker badly burnt, only one cup! no complimentary tea or coffee or course. All the rooms had a musty smell. The staff were variable, certainly not much of a welcome. The complimentary airport pickup had to be paid for. The bedding smelt of smoke, probably our worst hotel stay. This was more expensive than Ramee Hotel Aptments, which werent much good either but a slight improvement. This is a very mediochre chain, and just not worth it, much better to pay a bit more.'
1,'Horrible Terrible and Horrible again	Having had the great misfortune to book this hotel for 2 weeks in January 2007 i feel it is my duty to warn anyone else to try every other hotel before booking here. I could normaly look past the large but filthy rooms, some of the unfriendliest reception staff i have ever experienced and the fact that the place was not cleaned in all my time there.. But the fact that they never warned me that we would be woken up at 6:30 EVERY MORNING by the sound of hammers, drills and cranes from the building site next door was just sneaky..Even when i politely asked to be transfered to one of many spare rooms they had, facing away from the noise at least ,my request was not so politely refused. To sum up: pay $120 + for this place only if everywhere else in Dubai was closed...otherwise try one of the other Cleaner hotels around Bur Dubai'
1,'Okay if you need the space	We were in Dubai for 3 nights and have 2 children, both under the age of two. The Ramee II was good in that it has a seperate master bedroom and a large living/kitchen area. So with children, it was good to have the space.I have to agree with other reviews, however, that the Ramee II is not worth returning to. The rooms were not very clean and we too had the construction site right outside our window. Sometimes they worked until 11PM! It was only the fact that the jackhammers drowned out the sound of our screaming children that I didnt mind. The reception staff was friendly, but overall not helpful. We paid an extra $25/night for each child which was a disgrace since they didnt even provide extra linen for the children. (Im debating this with Expedia at the moment.) Plus, we were told that it would be no problem to have 2 port-a-cots (cribs) for the children and when we arrived there was one, very unsafe, wooden bassinet. Either of my children would have easily injured themselves had we used it. Without an alternative, the children slept with us. So it was no holiday.We booked this hotel at a sale price through Expedia. I would NEVER pay full price for a room in this hotel and would consider it to be about 3-3.5 star, not 4.'
