5,'Thank You	We would like to say Thank You to all of the staff who made our 8 night stay at the Residence &amp; Spa at the One &amp; Only Royal Mirage Dubai a most memorable holiday. The care and attention to detail is insurpassable and it has to be said that the team of staff have certainly been trained to the highest of standards. The managment team deserve credit as it is plain to see that their motivation, dedication and courtesy is reflected in all of the staff and it was an absolute pleasure to experience impeccable manners. The Residence as a whole is totally relaxing and had a lovely ambience. The food in the Dining Room is wonderful, well balanced menu s and exceptionally well presented. The chef s deserve a special thank you as every meal was a delight.We will most definately be staying at the Residence on future visits to Dubai.'
5,'A true Gem	I have just returned from my first visit to Dubai which I took with my family for a birthday celebration. I had heard a lot about how luxurious the hotels are in this part of the world so I had high expectations. The whole place is certainly luxurious but what puts this hotel on a plateau above others is it s intimacy. It only has 48 rooms and we were made to feel so special and valued by the staff. We were always greeted by name as we entered the building or even the lounge area. The building is low level and our room opened on to its own patio area which overlooked gardens and beyond - the sea. We were upgraded to a suite which was spacious and furnished the highest standard as were the standard rooms which our children occupied.The pool and gardens were top   and had an air of peace and tranquility, with luxurious sunbeds and gazebos offering shelter from the sun. However for people who want something more lively there is plenty going on at the Arabian Court and the Palace both for adults and children. Guests of the Residence are free to use the facilities at all the hotels,which is not the case for guests in the other hotels.The staff training is second to none because although staff are ultra attentive they do so without making you feel overpowered. Because it was a special birthday the hotel surprised me with flowers, cake and a spa treatment voucher. We didn t get to all eight restaurants but the Beach and Bar Grill,The Dining Room, The Rotisserie and the Eauzone were all excellent. We were on a half board basis so this helped with costs as Dubai is an expensive place to visit.When it was time to leave the staff once again thought of everything arranging taxis, wake up call and breakfast in our rooms at 4am.Five days was not long enough in thiswonderful hotel, so I hope it wont be long before we can return.'
5,'FABULOUS!	We have just returned from a wonderful 8 days at the Residence &amp; Spa. This was our first visit to this hotel (we normally stay at the Dar al Masayaf) and we were not disappointed. We decided at the last moment to take our two children (19 &amp; 21) with us and did wonder whether it may be a bit too stuffy for two students!!Not at all, they were made to feel so welcome by all the staff and loved the afternoon tea! It was our wedding anniversary and they upgraded us to a lovely suite and we were given some lovely little extras too. We ate most nights in the Dining room which was excellent. In fact, it was much better than the dinner we had at the Burj by a long way! Ate one evening at Ninas the indian restaurant which was excellent. We also ate at The Marina restaurant (part of Jumeriah beach hotel) which we always visit when in Dubai as it is excellent too!! What else can I say? Oh my only minor complaint if you can call it that is that I do think the pool area should be for adults only as there are pools that cater for children in the adjoining hotels. Although there were only one or two children there when we were there and they were well behaved I have to say, I would have preferred the peace of adultsonly. other than apart from the ugly building work going on in front (palm island!) and monorail station to the right it is a wonderful place to stay and would definitely revisit!! Oh, the spa is great too!!'
5,'Plush hotel shame about the view	The One and Only hotel Dubai is indeed a little gem in Dubai, it is hard to have a hotel on the beach in Dubai and not have a view of Cranes. Whilst most other hotels fail in this aspect (withthe exception of Atlantis sea facing rooms), the One and Only manages this superbly. Nestled on the Main Jumeria road the hotel covers a lot of surface area and is divided into differing residences, the more you pay the better the residence. On arrival you check in in a main hall exceot if you have a gold room where you are whisked off to a building on its own which possesses its own checkin. Staff are superbly trained and cater for most needs on requests. Breakfast is well provided for but the location on the main area can become crowded at times. The Spa (now renamed) was part of the Givanchy brand it seemed and has plenty of treatments but these can be obtained in other areas for less, most massage personel in hotels being highly skilled in the region. The pool outside is both open in terms of light and spacious giving the feeling you are not hemmed in with other people due to well laid out trees which can become a nusance when the sun moves and some seem to be placed in the pool so probably not best for lane swimmers. However this openness and caccooned feeling means you do not really see the sea or beach that much which given the cranes is no bad thing. Rooms are not a big difference to many you can find in Dubai, they are reasonably sized and have a nice seperate bathroom with wooden decor. Ultimately this hotel is superb, well managed and appointed, but given the price it is what you should expect. What makes this hotel stand out is access to the centre of town and exclusiveness and friendlyness.'
5,'Fabulous	Stayed here for 6 nights as our Honeymoon. We were upgraded to a suite, and there were many other lovely touches to our stay - rose petals on the bed etcBeautiful hotel with impeccable service. The food was excellent - the only meal we didn t enjoy was at Eau Zone, a shame as we ate there our last night as we d heard it was good. We would definitely return, although perhaps not in Aug as the humidity was almost unbearable.'
5,'absolutely fantastic	The residence and spa is a hotel to spend a week indulging in absolute luxury and quiet.The staff are brilliant and make you feel special, no request is too much for them.'
5,'Perfect in every way	It doesn t get any better than this. The hotel s exclusive ambience and the outstanding service make this hotel one of our favourite s in the world.We have stayed three times (once at the Arabian Court and twice at the Residence). The Residence is a cut above the rest...pure  . Unlike the Oalace and Arabian Court parts of the resort, The Residence is a chav free zone..there are too many people parading about in their (probably fake) designer gear at the other parts of the hotel. The Residence has it s own exclusive pool are and restaurant that the Palace and Arabian Court guests are not allowed access to. This gives it an air of mystery to the &quot;outsiders&quot; and you quite often see peple wandering trhough for a sneeky peek! The staff at The Residence do not allow outsiders to use the pool area, so it s always lovely and quiet with plety of places to lie out.The rooms are incredible. We stayed in a junior suite, which is huge. The large marble bathroom is very luxurious and the room has every amenity you will need.The hotel s restaurants are top   - in fact we didn t leave the resort to eat. There are 7 or 8 different restaurants, each with a slightly different theme.'
5,'Sheer bliss	We have been lucky enough to stay here every year for the last 4 years and i simply wouldnt go anywhere else for relaxation.Out of the 3 hotels within The Royal Mirage , this is the smaller with 50 bedrooms so therfore more intimate with staff addressing you by name and remembering what you like to eat and drink.Bedrooms are very spacious with incredibly comfy beds, even the z bed our daughter slept on was comfy.Clean fluffy towels were replenished every morning and night as were the lovely Molton Brown toiletries.Cool towels round the pool twice a day, sorbet and/or fresh fruit and continually flowing complimentary water are all nice touches which i believe arent in every hotel.Our 4 year old daughter was treated like a princess so much so she cried when she woke up on our last day as she didnt want to come home (shes allready filling up her piggy bank for our next trip)Children are more than welcome here although they may prefer the pool at The Arabian Court where they can make more noise and splash in and out of the pool.We tend to spend the day flitting between beach, Residence pool and Arabian Court pool (dont think i could have done the whole day around the AC pool surrounded by fat sunburnt Brits swigging beer!).Afternoon tea in The Library, also complimentary, is outstanding and management always make themselves visible and chat to each guest.Breakfast, whether room service or eaten in The Dining Room is great with a huge variety. With a food allergy which can be a pain when eating away from home, i was well catered for.Nina (AC), Beach Bar and Grill (Palace) and Tagine (Palace) all great but if you want buffet style then head to Rottiserie (AC) or Olives (Palace).The hotel and grounds (including the beach) are spotlessly clean and all staff greet you from the maintenance to manager.For my husbands birthday a cake, flowers and present (voucher for Hamman treatment) were left in our room after breakfast.When we stayed for New Year we were given a recipie book, dates and photo frame and our daughter a story book and stuffed camel!This hotel has a return rate of around 80% which is a sign of how good it really is.With the global economy the way it is at the moment there are lots of cut price offers for The Palace and Arabian Court but, without sounding like a snob, these two hotels are therefore, attracting in the afformentioned fat sunburnt Brits.If you want to be a name and not just a number, peace and quiet and total relaxation then The Residence really is the place to stay.Now im off to hunt down the back of the sofa for loose change to start saving for our next visit!'
5,'Again another magical stay .....	This is the best hotel in Dubai, that s why we return, year after year!!The simple personal touches, attention to detail and shere luxury, the Residence &amp; Spa has it all, 400%!We travelled with my parents and had an interconnecting Prestige Room &amp; Junior suite. Great for travelling with kids as they have space to cool down during noon, as we went inside then because of the heat.Breakfast at the Dining Room - delicious, dinner at the Dining Room - superb, dinner at the Rotisserie (Arabian Court) - plenty of choice for the kiddies and delicious, dinner at Nina - the Indian place to dine!Menu at both the Dining Room and The Rotisserie should be changed a little more often as the same dishes turned up. But then again, not many guests stay for 12 nights .....Afternoon tea at the Library: scumptious!!!And yes, use the well equipped gym at the Spa after that :-))))))Oh, you like to go out? Check out the Kasbar (next to the Palace)!!!! Expensive drinks but great nightclub, even for us (in our forties with 3 kids - hahahaha!).Many thanks again to Mr Philippe, Fikri, Roshan, Mary (KidsOnly), Raj (pool), The Dining room Chef, and all other staff who made our 12 night stay memorable again.We shall return, soon ....................'
5,'Beautiful Hotel	I highly recommend this hotel. We got waited on hand and foot and could not have asked for a better hotel stay. This hotel and all the staff made our holiday magical.It is true what they say...you get what you pay for!!'
1,'Not be revisited or recommended	We visited Dubai and stayed at two different hotels.Start of our holiday stayed at 4point Sheraton on Sheikh Zahid road. That was with a group of five family members a good stay. Then as my brother and I were left to fly back 2 days later, we changed hotels to Sun and Sand.To start the check in took more than an hour. It was manual; they were calling various people to confirm our booking. We had booked and prepaid for our stay via lastminute. Receptionist was first unable to find any reservation. Then managed this by calling various offices, she was very unhelpful. Then demanded to keep our passports, which I refused.On the hotel would say it has dated decor. The hallways smelled bad, the carpet was old and dirty. The room was spacious however, dated decor, bed cover old and dirty.Due to the smell in the hallway, it was hard to breathe in the room.Service and room hygiene were poor.Location is ok.'
1,'Won t be visting again	Spent 7 nights at the Sun and Sands Hotel in October 2007Situated in Deira, the old part of Dubai, this is a bit off the beaten track if you want to be nearer the newer parts such as Bur Dubai and Jumeirah thus we spent most of our time getting in and out of taxi s (which were not always easy to get because of the hotels location).The reception staff were inattentive and seemed generally disinterested in us. This may have been a cultural issue as we may have been the only Europeans staying there. The other guests were either Arabic or Iranian.Well decorated throughout all the rooms had a good sense of elegance except for the Churchill Bar just off the reception which looked like a tacky games room with two pool tables and electronic games. Not bad food there though.Bedrooms were a reasonable size. Two double beds, table and two smallarmchairs. Very clean throughout, especially the bathroom which againwas a good size with various complementary toiletries. No tea and coffee making facilities which was a disappointment but not the end of the world as there was an excellent room service menu from which you could get a pot of coffee for about £1 - not bad I thought!Limited TV channels if you want to watch it, and those that were in English had a very poor reception. Did not bother us as Dubai has more to offer that than sitting in your hotel room.No real entertainment in the hotel. They boast two nightclubs on the same floor, one Russian the other Arabian. Neither gave us a warm welcome so did not stay.Not sure what the restaurants were like as did not go but they lookednice when we looked in. Breakfast came as part of the deal but did not get down once to try it, as out until all hours enjoying all thatDubai has to offer.Overall this is an average hotel with not the best staff I have ever encountered which, in our opinion, is also not in the best location to maximise your stay in Dubai..'
1,'Very disappointing	When a colleague and I unexpectedly found ourselves stranded in Dubai for a day, we asked Marhaba Services at Dubai Airport to reserve us a 4-star hotel. We were assigned to the Sun and Sands Hotel. I travel a great deal, and believe me this is no 4-star hotel. And don t let the hotel s name fool you - although Dubai is a beach destination, the only sand around this property is that to be found strewn about the big construction site across the street! There were burn holes in the sheets and bedspread in my room, and the bathroom fixtures were old and corroded. The water never got even warm, let alone hot, no matter how long I let it run in the shower. Furthermore, my colleague reported that when he took a shower, he was struck hard in the back of his head because the entire shower head flew off! When he was checking out, a staff member actually came up and grabbed him by his shirt, showed him the shower head (which he had left in his room), and accused him of destroying it!Some of the restaurants in the hotel were closed and the ones that were open looked very unappealing and empty. There did not appear to be many other dining options in the neighborhood, which is hard to navigate due to current road construction. We ended up going to lunch at the nearby Mayfair Hotel, which has an excellent buffet and very helpful staff. I can also recommend the Al Safadi restaurant, which has excellent Lebanese food - it s about a 5-10 minute walk through a veritable obstacle course of traffic barriers (ask staff for directions). If you manage to get there without being run over, the food is quite good and reasonably priced.The pounding noise from the disco (or discos) at the Sun and Sands made sleep difficult to impossible (we were on the first floor), and the staff couldn t have cared less when we complained. The promised “broadband” Internet was also non-existent--after spending nearly $20 for an Internet access card and then waiting in the business center for nearly 10 minutes to get even one web page to load only partially, I gave up in frustration. Again, the staff did not care. To top it all off, on the way out of town, my colleague nearly missed his flight because the hotel shuttle back to the airport made a long detour without prior warning to drop some other guests off at the beach.As noted by the previous reviewer, this hotel seems to cater to a clientele from Iran and various Arab countries - I also saw numerous Russians. By their standards, this might qualify as 4-star, but my colleague and I found the place very disappointing in quality and not at all worth the price of slightly more than $200 per night that we paid (and this was a discount over their outrageous posted rack rates of $327 per night!).'
1,'Very Awefull place	Rooms were very small and a little dark and at night there are loud sounds which could easily be heard from the night club until 1 o clock at midnight and you couldn t rest and be relax with so loud sounds.our rooms TV set had problem but it remained until the end of the time which we were there and hotels technisian wasn t able to fix it.the lobby was awefull becuase of being very small place.I won t to be there again and not saticfy to be there.'	 
1,'Aweful Hotel	never suggest this hotel to anyone.The rooms are dark and underexposed, the A/C not work properly, the room is not clean as you want, its staff are not friendly and helpful. Aweful breakfast and lunch buffet, just for Indians and Pakistanians. The food was aweful.'
1,'rating below one star definitely wouldn t recommend	dirty room, black mould all around bath, reported it to reception,no response!!! staff very unfriendly. breakfast buffet was a joke !! wouldn t recommend it to my worst enemy."
1,'This average 3 star hotel is conveniently located in the city centre. Walking distance from main shopping centres. Reasonable comfortable rooms at reasonable price. Nice buffet breakfast.Ground floor disco which is usually noisy at nights. Personally I found it disturbing. Plus this place tends to be flooded with Russian prostitutes at nights. Strickly speaking, hotel policy does not allow any visitors in the guest rooms, off the record it does happen.Hard to find a taxi in the mornings, until 10AM. Reception staff can be busy at times and you might have to sit there in front of them, waiting to have a word.Overall it s a reasonable hotel in the city centre. I suggest to book through a reputable travel agent e.g. Expedia and save money.'
1,'12km to the beach	The hotel is conveniently located for most of the major attractions of Dubai but the staff were unfriendly and abrupt right from the moment I arrived at the hotel. Our passports were taken from us in order to fulfil &quot;police requirements&quot;. The breakfast restaurant was adequate with a buffet of not very appetising surprises and the staff were only very vaguely interested in the guests. When we asked the porter to call a taxi he tried to add an extra 50% to the fare so as to compensate his effort. At the pool bar the resident Doctor Do-Little watched tv, smoked and gawked at female swimmers.All in all a clean place with close proximity to a good range of restaurants but don t expect a welcome from the staff.'
1,'Poor Customer Service :(	I was picked up by the minibus provided by the hotel and I checked in early. All was good at the early stages, however I was disappointed when I went to the room and found that there was grease stains on the tiles in the kitchen and dirt/grime around the tap. This put me off cooking there. I then proceeded to the bathroom room and the toilet bowl was not cleaned properly and there was faeces splashed all aound it. I asked for someone to clean this up. They did this quick quickly. When I went back down to reception I was asked for payment straight away and given no explanation why this was needed. The receptionist was quite rude. I gave my passport to be scanned when I arrived, it took 6 hours for them to return it to me. However, they asked for it again and was not given a reason for this. There were also a lot of cooking smells in our room as the ventilation was poor. The staff are quite arrogant and rude and as it was the Dubai Shopping Festival we could not find anywhere esle to stay. The male staff were rude especially to females but not as much to men.'
1,'Avoid this Corrupt Racist Hotel	Booked online via AsiaRooms.com, obtaining a 2 night stay for US$ 122 per room per night inclusive taxes.Arrived to be told they had no record of my reservation. Pulled out the printed confirmation, but after 20 minutes the lady receptionist said they had not received it. She told me they have rooms available, at US$190 - exactly the same room type I booked. They would not listen to my protests and clearly enjoyed the &quot;do not care&quot; and snobby attitudue of putting someone through a stressful frustrating time.I was about to give in, when an indian gentleman arrived to check-in - and guess what - at the rate of US$122. I pointed this out and the lady told me the lower rates are only for Indian nationals, as Europeans can afford to pay more. I was now at boiling point and asked to see the manager, who was either conveniently not around, or who is not bothered anyway. I left and booked into an Apartment hotel just down the road.I just wished Id read this site review before booking!!'
