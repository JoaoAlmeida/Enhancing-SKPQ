1,'Best location and accommodation of the Jumeirah Properties	We have just returned from a week stay at the beit al bahar villas. The accomodation, service, and faclities were excellent. We did however get upgraded from a 1bed villa to a 2bed villa due to construction in front of our patio. The difference was huge. The 2 bedroom villa has a far larger patio with 4 deckchairs and over looked the beach and the burj. The 1 bed villa was located on the first row with a view onto the nearby villas- pretty disappointing. So make sure if you stay here you request a villa in the 3rd row- those with views over the beach and the burj al arab.I have stayed at the mina and jumeirah beach hotel and these villas are the best we have stayed in. They have an arabic feel and with an extensive patio with loungers and a plunge pool- you couldnt get better accomodation.Each villa has a huge living room - L-shaped sofa and a separate table with 4chairs. You also get a latop with free internet access. The bathroom is amazing with the largest and deepest bath I have ever seen- takes around 30mins to fill up!You also have access to the private beach for execuvite/premium/madinat/burj guests. Also, there is a pool just for villa guests with a small outdoor bar/restaurant in the middle of the villa area. There is also a villa restaurant just for villa guests which we only went to for breakfast.The best thing is that you dont need to walk through a large hotel to get to the beach/pool- u just leave ur villa and u are there. It makes it a much more relaxing holiday.'
1,'Our favourite place in Dubai	We had a fabulour time here. The privacy is the best, relaxing in your garden with a plunge pool, brought sandwiches at 4.00, drinks at the beautiful bar/pool at 7.00. The two bedroom villa we had was very spacious and I love the Arabian decor, staff all very attentive and call you by name. A little name card is put up on the wall outside, all nice touches to make you feel welcome and at home. It is great being able to call the buggies especially for BAB guests. Bulgari toiletries in both bathrooms, internet area, lounge and long hall. The Burj is fab too but the being able to sit outside just gives it the edge. Cant wait to return, if you go here you will not be disappointed.'
1,'Wow This Is Dubai At Its Best!	Four of us stayed for a week in March 2007 at the Beit Al Bahar Villas, what an experience simply incredible beautiful villas sumptiously furnished and waited on hand and foot, This is the place to be pampered. The only interruptions we had were the helicopters landing on the helipad at the Burj . If you want a wonderfully relaxing stay in Dubai book these villas, nothing to compare. Margaret Swansea Wales.'
1,'Absolute perfection!	The property is absolutely beautiful; we loved all the traditional Arabic accents and decorations as well as the comforting environment in the room. We were able to fully &amp; completely relax while at our villa and at the beach. We were so comfortable and relaxed we didn’t even worry about locking our doors while we were out or locking up our cameras while we swam in the ocean. Not having to worry about the little things, made a big difference to our trip. There are so many examples of the Beit Al Bahar and the Jumeriah Beach Hotel staff ensuring we didn’t have to worry or think about anything. The only time we really had to think, was when we tried to decide where to eat at the many fantastic Jumeriah International restaurants! The Beit Al Bahar staff was always so kind and helpful and they truly anticipated our needs, sometimes before we even knew what our needs were! One afternoon after a day on the beach, we were in our villa debating going to get a light snack as we didn’t have dinner reservations until 10pm. Literally, during this discussion, our doorbell rang and the villa staff brought us afternoon tea. This was completely unexpected and was appreciated for many reasons – anticipating our needs, a light snack and most importantly – a traditional experience. When we sadly left Dubai, the item which stood out from our trip the most was the people. Every single person we interacted with was extremely friendly, kind and helpful. We have never been surrounded by such hospitality and such wonderful people! We have stayed at other “The Leading Hotels of the World”, while they all live up to a higher standard; the Jumeriah Beach Hotel exceeds this standard.'
1,'The Ultimate	The Beit Al Bahar villas are simply stunning. We have stayed here on 2 occassions, and both times have been completey overwhelmed by the sheer luxury and levels of service. My husband had a days sea fishing from the hotel - on his return a member of the villas staff was waiting in a golf buggy at the marina with cold face towels and freezing water ready to take him back to our villa. Our 7 year old daughter had a great time - again the staff whisked her off in a buggy to the kids club and picked her up when she was ready, also the wild and wadi water park is on your doorstep and you get priority entry at all times. I really can not think of one negative thing to say about this place - it is pure luxury!!Although terribly expensive, I would always hope we will be fortunate enought to go back again.'
1,'What a wonderful hotel - top luxury	Had a fantastic stay here for 7 days last Sept.Lovely hotel, very relaxed place great to just chill out. Fantastic pool and leisure facilities and very spacious rooms with great shower / wet room.Great restaurants and top quality food.Service in all areas was top and all the staff went that extra mile to try and assist you.My only complaint about Dubai was that the availability of taxis was a nightmare, maybe because it was at the end of Ramandan, we often had to wait for 45 minutes plus outside some shopping malls to get a taxi. It needs to get this sorted asap if it is going to compete with other major cities.This hotel is top notch also with quality furniture and fittings throughout.The Burj al Arab is all glitz and no substance in comparison.I would definately pay that bit extra and stay at the Residence &amp; Spa.LightingMan 
1,'Simply the best	My family and i stayed at the mirage residence after staying at almost all the jumeira beach hotels.I must say we are always going to stay here from now on. Anyone who has been to dubai will tell you that even the 3 star hotel standards are comparable to 4-5 star hotel in other countries.The residence is definately for the traveler that does not want to be bothered by noise or families with no regard or respect for the peace of other travelers. I was glad that only residence guests had the exclusive use of the dedicated pool area, But also loved the fact that we could use all the facilities of the Arabian court and palace. Staff are the best and usually address you by your name which is a great touch.perfect hotel and well worth the price you pay 
1,'Beautiful Hotel	I highly recommend this hotel. We got waited on hand and foot and could not have asked for a better hotel stay. This hotel and all the staff made our holiday magical.It is true what they say...you get what you pay for!!'
1,'Again another magical stay .....	This is the best hotel in Dubai, that s why we return, year after year!!The simple personal touches, attention to detail and shere luxury, the Residence &amp; Spa has it all, 400%!We travelled with my parents and had an interconnecting Prestige Room &amp; Junior suite. Great for travelling with kids as they have space to cool down during noon, as we went inside then because of the heat.Breakfast at the Dining Room - delicious, dinner at the Dining Room - superb, dinner at the Rotisserie (Arabian Court) - plenty of choice for the kiddies and delicious, dinner at Nina - the Indian place to dine!Menu at both the Dining Room and The Rotisserie should be changed a little more often as the same dishes turned up. But then again, not many guests stay for 12 nights .....Afternoon tea at the Library: scumptious!!!And yes, use the well equipped gym at the Spa after that :-))))))Oh, you like to go out? Check out the Kasbar (next to the Palace)!!!! Expensive drinks but great nightclub, even for us (in our forties with 3 kids - hahahaha!).Many thanks again to Mr Philippe, Fikri, Roshan, Mary (KidsOnly), Raj (pool), The Dining room Chef, and all other staff who made our 12 night stay memorable again.We shall return, soon ....................'
1,'absolutely fantastic	The residence and spa is a hotel to spend a week indulging in absolute luxury and quiet.The staff are brilliant and make you feel special, no request is too much for them.'
0,'Good and bad	Overall our experience was OK. The two bedroom apartment we had was pretty clean, but everything needed updated. Leaks in the plumbing, washing machine did not work. Electrical problems. TV remotes were missing the backs. The windows were filthy. Very difficult to get a cab. When the hotel called a cab for you, you were over charged quite a bit. I was charged for an extra day, even though I had called three days prior to cancel the first day. Most of the staff were nice and helpful. Location of the hotel is in a bad part of Dubai, but the price was very good compared to other more modern parts of Dubai. Music late at night from the hotel bar was loud and could be heard in the rooms. Personally, I would not stay there again, but if you dont mind an older hotel with a lousy restaurant, I would say give it a try.'
0,'To be avoided at all costs	We stayed here last week, last stop after Australia. It was overall a very negative experience, our lst room was surrounded by building sites, noise overwhelming so we asked to be changed. Our next room was next to the mosque so we were awoken at an unearthly hour! The rooms were spacious but not clean, the hood of the cooker badly burnt, only one cup! no complimentary tea or coffee or course. All the rooms had a musty smell. The staff were variable, certainly not much of a welcome. The complimentary airport pickup had to be paid for. The bedding smelt of smoke, probably our worst hotel stay. This was more expensive than Ramee Hotel Aptments, which werent much good either but a slight improvement. This is a very mediochre chain, and just not worth it, much better to pay a bit more.'
0,'A better hotel would have been worth every Dirham!	I counted a total of two staff people on arrival at 8pm. The receptionist and the Bellman. The AC wasnt working in the first room we were assigned to... it took too long for a maintenance person to show-up, so we packed our bags and were ready to leave before they moved our room. After we requested toilet paper, the Bellman came with an un boxed, unwrapped bunch of facial tissue. Imagine the joy! Apparently, housekeeping was gone for the night and noone could get into the supplies. The following evening, the wait for toilet paper turned from a promise of five minutes to a 45 minute wait. The beds are worn beyond use... but theyre still there. The bathrooms had a stench coming from the drainage pipes in the floor. After the first night, went upstairs to the top floor to check out the breakfast.... youll find that the breakfast room is a room off to the side of the GYM! You have to go into the gym to have breakfast. The whole deal didnt seem sanitary, so we passed on the breakfast offerings during our stay. The Ramee Group is a pretty large, &quot;middle market&quot; chain, and Ive stayed at an Ramee in Bahrain (minus the negative experience), but clearly, the qulaity of the property and service is not consistent and is lacking heavily at the Guestline Apartments II in Dubai.'
0,'Okay if you need the space	We were in Dubai for 3 nights and have 2 children, both under the age of two. The Ramee II was good in that it has a seperate master bedroom and a large living/kitchen area. So with children, it was good to have the space.I have to agree with other reviews, however, that the Ramee II is not worth returning to. The rooms were not very clean and we too had the construction site right outside our window. Sometimes they worked until 11PM! It was only the fact that the jackhammers drowned out the sound of our screaming children that I didnt mind. The reception staff was friendly, but overall not helpful. We paid an extra $25/night for each child which was a disgrace since they didnt even provide extra linen for the children. (Im debating this with Expedia at the moment.) Plus, we were told that it would be no problem to have 2 port-a-cots (cribs) for the children and when we arrived there was one, very unsafe, wooden bassinet. Either of my children would have easily injured themselves had we used it. Without an alternative, the children slept with us. So it was no holiday.We booked this hotel at a sale price through Expedia. I would NEVER pay full price for a room in this hotel and would consider it to be about 3-3.5 star, not 4.'
0,'Horrible Terrible and Horrible again	Having had the great misfortune to book this hotel for 2 weeks in January 2007 i feel it is my duty to warn anyone else to try every other hotel before booking here. I could normaly look past the large but filthy rooms, some of the unfriendliest reception staff i have ever experienced and the fact that the place was not cleaned in all my time there.. But the fact that they never warned me that we would be woken up at 6:30 EVERY MORNING by the sound of hammers, drills and cranes from the building site next door was just sneaky..Even when i politely asked to be transfered to one of many spare rooms they had, facing away from the noise at least ,my request was not so politely refused. To sum up: pay $120 + for this place only if everywhere else in Dubai was closed...otherwise try one of the other Cleaner hotels around Bur Dubai 
0,'Dark rooms	Stayed here for 2 weeks (booked initially for 4). The location is still pretty much a building site across dubai internet city, next to street 611 in The Greens. The views are either onto the next block, the building site or Sheik Zayed Road - so not really appealing.We booked a 1 room apartment - the pictures of the hotel on their web site are for real: the rooms are soo dark, you have to have the lights on during the whole day. The airco was so noisy and windy, that we had to turn it off to prevent headaches.The room service was ok, they even cleaned the dirty dishes.If you have to stay on a budget (around 16,000AED per month) and dont mind looking on a building site/busy street, it might be ok 
0,'Avoid it if you can	This is a very disappointing hotel and represents poor value for money. Okay, it might be less expensive by normal Dubai standards but you cant help getting that ripped off feeling. I have read other reviews that said the rooms are small. That is an understatement. It appears clean but is badly in need of basic maintenance and decoration. The basin in our bathroom was blocked and we had to share with a cockroach but the hot water was plentiful. Most staff were friendly and helpful but one was quite the opposite. Our advice would be pay a little extra and avoid this one. It has the potential to take the shine off your holiday.'
0,'Don t go here	This hotel was very disappointing. Despite advertising airport pick-up our request was totally ignored. We found it impossible to stay in the first room we were allocated. It was very stuffy and the air conditioning which was nearly non-existent did not do anything to help. The window had been screwed down and was impossible to open. We asked to change rooms and the second room was inhabitable despite the cracked sink and leaking bath!. A fellow guest with the same problem decided not to stay at all and checked out immediately to go and find another hotel. The working staff were anxious to help us, especially in the restaurant where the food was good value for money, but the management was very poor. This was an experience we would not wish to repeat.'
0,'worlds worst pick-up joint.	This is  the  worst place ever. It is a dirty disgusting pick-up joint!As soon as you walk into the bar after about 6pm, you will be visited by numerous amounts of woman, asking you if you have any requests!!!!!! If you know what i mean.The rooms were disgusting, the music from the club below bellowed until the early hours, filling the whole hotel with unbearable noise. If you are single, have little or no money, and dont mind sleeping it (totally) rough in Dubai, then this is the place for you!'
0,'(--) up place	One of the lousiest hotel we have stayed in our life. The front desk lady ( Ms. Sunita) was kind enough to give us two room s- one 1 hr. late, another 3.5 hr late after stipulated time. No water to drink, you have to buy water bottle and pay 6 dirhams instead of 1 dirhams. Breakfast is pathetic, stale bread, instead of Juice some Tang, fruits only watermelon, old vegetables. The dirty hotel with full of mouse. The room boys are unhelpful and only try to fleece you.  The bar is also bad place with only fat aunties gyrating to some hindi songs.. So if you want to experience hell , liked to be cheated and enjoy the fleecing by others please check into this hotel and ask for Ms. Sunita.'
